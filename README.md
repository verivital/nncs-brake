# Brake-system
Closed loop system of the brake dynamics of the Carla simulator.


The .slx files are the simulink files containing the neural network blocks. 

Actormodel corresponds to the controller and CarlaDynamicsModel corresponds to the plant.

The mat files correspond to the network's information in MATLAB.

actormodel.mat corresponds to the controller's info with the required format to use the nnv tool.

Carla_dynamics.mat corresponds to the plant's info in the same format.

CarlaDynamicsModel_net.mat corresponds to the neural network object in MATLAB format.
